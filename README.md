# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
1. INSPECT THE DATA: For obvious inconsistencies and errors. Data types, abrupt changes in formatting.
2. BECOME FAMILIARIZED: Inspections leading to understanding the data better

    * expected versus unexpected data results.
    * what are meanings represented by the data columns and values 
3. CLEANING: Beginning to fix the errors and inconsistencies.
4. VERIFICATION: After implementing changes to the database, queries are used to test the data to verify the changes, and ideally validate their necessity. 
5. DOCUMENTATION: keeping track of the changes made, with self-commenting code and concise notes for changes done and relevant rationales.

## Challenges 
TIME was absolutely the most precious resource for this project.  So the primary challenges I personally faced, were associated with either some form of how my own time was underutilized or misused.  These were losses spent appropriately within the processes of learning novel skills and techniques - however painful - and are therefor worthy of notation:
* Having to fight against paralysis at times, regarding where and how to get started
* Time spent acclimating to the process: 
    * To developing a routine and a method
    * Missing or ineffectively attempting the **documentation step** in the earlier stages of inspecting and attempting to become familiar with the data.   
        >Initially; I transitioned from evidently imagining I could preserve a rolling memory of the database's exploration, the queries I had written, and their subsequent output results. To a seemingly random distribution of a series of disorganized post-it notes, ultimately donated to the Desk-clutter Gods.  Eventually my process did evolve into maintaining a living document capable of safekeeping the queries I generated and their associated inquiry details within a readable logical context.  Significantly more progress would have been accomplished had I discovered this technique earlier on in the process.
* Software performance issues:
    * Software issues are a necessary component of an industry so defined by the dynamic inter-connectivity of so many independently fluctuating components. In this project, there were significant delays in setting up the database which accounted for approx 10% - 15% of the time spent of this project. 

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
* Completed the analysis of the data.
* I believe I barely scratched the surface of the cleaning processes that would have benefited this database.
the all_sessions table specifically could be subdivided into numerous smaller tables, which would have significantly improved the accessability of the data contained within it.  
* This database appears to have many interactive components and I would have liked to have performed many more cross analyses of column data sets to enable the creation of all appropriate entity relationships, as this would facilitate further inter-database analyses.
